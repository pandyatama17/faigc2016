            This tour is visiting Uluwatu temple, amazing temple perching on the edge of stiff cliff on the South Coast. After enjoying the phenomenal sunset then seeing the fascinating and amazing MONKEY Dance depicts an epic from the Ramayana sage.This interesting dance has no musical accompaniment; there is no gamelan or any other instrument. The rhythm is provided by chanting monkey chorus. It is performed by over 100 men, sitting in circle around a large branching torch constantly chanting “chak”. The rhythm sound of the chanting gave the name of this dance “ke – chak”.The swaying and bending of their bodies, the raising and stretching of their hands, makes it a living theater with all the dramatic effect. The bizarre monkey-like sounds, and the fierce series of hissing, makes it a very unnerving dance, which undoubtedly will haunt you for a long time. The Kecak dance turns every viewer into a child, wide-eye and transfixed.
